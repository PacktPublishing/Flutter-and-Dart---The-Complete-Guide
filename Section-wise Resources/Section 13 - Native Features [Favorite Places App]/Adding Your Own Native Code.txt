Adding Your Own Native Code
With Flutter, when using native device features, you'll very likely use external packages most of the time - like the ImagePicker or GoogleMaps packages used in this section.

But if you need to tap into a certain native device functionality that's not exposed by any package, you can also write your own native code and connect that to your Flutter code.

It's a rarely needed feature but this page from the official documentation explains how you could add your own native code: https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels
