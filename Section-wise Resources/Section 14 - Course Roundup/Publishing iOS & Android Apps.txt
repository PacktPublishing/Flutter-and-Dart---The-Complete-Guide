Publishing iOS & Android Apps
Ultimately, after building and thoroughly testing your Flutter app, you might want to publish it to Google's Play Store or Apple's AppStore.

Publishing to these stores is actually not really difficult but involves a couple of steps. Hence it's best to go through the official, written, step-by-step instructions for the different platforms:

Publish an Android App: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android

Publish an iOS App: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios

In those guides, you don't just learn how to publish your apps but also how to configure their icons, titles & more useful settings.
